‚ö†Ô∏è Advisory
‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendation: Keep as Single File‚ö†Ô∏è

While the code can be split into 15+ separate files, I strongly recommend keeping it as one HTML file for this project because:
-Simplicity: Single file is easier to deploy and manage
-No Server Required: Works directly in browser without web server
-No Build Process: No need for bundling or compilation
-Easy Distribution: Share one file instead of entire folder structure
-LocalStorage Limitation: Since we're using localStorage instead of a backend, the single-file approach aligns with the frontend-only architecture

When to Split:
-If you plan to add a backend server
-If the project grows beyond 2000+ lines
-If multiple developers will work on it
-If you need advanced build tools and optimization

For this loan management platform's current scope and requirements, the single-file approach is optimal! üéØ
